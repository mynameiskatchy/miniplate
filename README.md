# README.md: miniplate

Miniplate is a minimalistic and unopinionated boilerplate to jumpstart the app set-up process without the bloat. This boilerplate makes use of node/express, babel, webpack, react, typescript, and css, along with hot-reloading via nodemon and webpack.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequesites

Node.js and npm

### Installing

After cloning repo, install node module dependencies via terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, build webpack bundle. This will output a bundle.js file in the build to be referenced by index.html.

```bash
npm build
```

Next, you can start the project in a few ways (via node server or webpack depending on your needs):

via webpack dev server

```bash
npm start
```

via nodemon dev server

```bash
npm run dev-server-start
```

via node server

```bash
npm run
```
